# Lets create a telegram bot!

This is a plugin base and clean template for telegram bots using **Pyrogram**. there is three plugins for sample:

- **system**: base functionalities like up time, help command and "Hi" for pinging.
- **shahvani**: this plugin scraps a pornography website and sends you some nudes.
- **messenger**: this plugin sends income messages to two channels, one channel as unknown sender, other as known sender.

# Deploy

you can use this bot on your own telegram easily:

- copy source code to your server (or google colab)
- copy `.env.example` file as `.env` and replace your own values
- install dependencies by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
